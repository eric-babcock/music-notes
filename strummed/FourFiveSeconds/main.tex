\textbf{Intro:} D
\textbf{Verse 1}
[D]I think I've had [G]enough, 
[Bm]I might get a little dr[A]unk
[D]I say what's on [G]my mind,
[Bm]I might do a little ti[A]me
[D]'Cause all of my [G]kindness. 
[Bm]Is taken for weak[A]ness

\textbf{Chorus}
Now I'm [D]four, five seconds from [G]wildin'
And we [Bm]got three more days 'til [A]Friday
I'm just [D]tryna make it back home by [G]Monday mornin'
I [Bm]swear I wish somebody would tell me
[A]Ooh, that's all I want

\textbf{Verse 2}

\textbf{Chorus}

\textbf{Bridge}
[D]And I know that you're up tonight
[G]Thinkin' how could I be so selfish
[Bm]But you called 'bout a thousand times
[A]Wondering where I've been
[D]Now I know that you're up tonight
[G]Thinkin' how could I be so reckless
[Bm]But I just can't apologize
I hope you can [A]understand, yeah

\textbf{Verse 3}

\textbf{Chorus x2}

Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive (We can run)
Then I heard you were talkin' trash (I'm on a mystery)
Hold me back, I'm bout' to spaz
\columnbreak
If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See, all of my kindness, (mhm)
Is taken for weakness
