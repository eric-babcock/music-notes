[Intro]
 
F
 
 
[Verse]
 
  F
I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire
    F
You come to me, come to me wild and wired
                 Dm
When you come to me
                    Bb   Bb (ring)
Give me everything I need
          F
Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams
 
Speak the language of love like you know what it means
                 Dm
ohh, it can't be wrong
                          Bb
Take my heart and make it stronger baby
 
C C C N.C.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                      F
You're simply the best, better than all the rest
            Dm                  C7
Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met
                  F
I'm stuck on your heart, I hang on every word you say
         Dm                 C7
Tear us apart, baby I would rather be dead
 
 
[Verse]
 
             F
In your heart I see the stars of every night and every day
 
In your eyes I get lost, I get washed away
        Dm
Just as long as I'm here in your arms
                Bb
I could be in no better place
 
C C C N.C.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                      F
You're simply the best, better than all the rest
            Dm                  C7
Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met
                  F
I'm stuck on your heart, I hang on every word you say
         Dm                 C7
Tear us apart, baby I would rather be dead
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Bb
 Each time you leave me I start losing control
       Dm
You're walking away with my heart and my soul
Bb
 I can feel you even when I'm alone
C                   D
 Oh baby, don't let go

               G
You're the best, better than all the rest
            Em                  D7
Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met
                  G
I'm stuck on your heart, and hang on every word you say
         Em                 D7
Tear us apart, baby I would rather be dead
                   G (ring)
Oh, you're the best...
