[Intro]
 
G
I wanna dedicate this next song to, um
 
A very special someone in my life
 
David Rose
 
 
[Verse 1]
G
I call you when I need you and my heart's on fire
G
You come to me wild and wired
            Em Em7              C
You come to me and give me everything I need
 
[Verse 2]
G
Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams
G
Speak the language of love like you know what it means
               Em     Em7                         C     D
And I can't be wrong, take my heart and make it stronger
 
 
[Chorus]
                  G
You're simply the best, Better than all the rest
            Em                    D        D/F#
Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met
                      G
And I'm stuck on your heart, I hang on every word you say
              Em                     D        D/F#
Well, tear us apart, Baby, I would rather be dead
 
 
[Verse 3]
G
In your heart, I see the the start of every night and every day
G
In your eyes, I get lost, I get washed away
                    Em Em7             C                       D/F#
Just as long as I'm here in your arms, I can be in no better place
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                  G
You're simply the best, Better than all the rest
            Em                  D/F#
Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met
                      G
And I'm stuck on your heart, I hang on every word you say
              Em                      D           D/F#
Well, tear us apart, Baby, I would rather be dead, oh
 
 
[Bridge]
C
Each time you leave me, I start losing control
Em
Like you're walking away with my heart and my soul
C
I can feel you, babe, even when I'm alone
D
Baby, don't let go ' Cause
 
 
[Chorus]
                  G
You're simply the best, Better than all the rest
            Em                   D        D/F#
Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met
                      G
And I'm stuck on your heart, I hang on every word you say
              Em                      D            D/F#
Well, tear us apart, Baby, I would rather be dead, oh
 
 
[Outro]

Ooh, ooh
G
Oh, you're the best
