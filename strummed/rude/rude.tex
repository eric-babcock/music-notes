[Verse]
 
  F         G                   C
Saturday morning jumped out of bed
     Am
And put on my best suit
 F         G                    C
Got in my car and raced like a jet
 Am
All the way to you
  F               G                    C
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
    Am
To ask you a question
   F                 G                      C    Am
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man, yeah
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
 F                                G
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
     C                     Am
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
               F                               G
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
       C                          Am
Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is 'No'
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 F            G
Why you gotta be so rude?
 C                    Am
Don't you know I'm human too?
 F             G
Why you gotta be so rude?
 C        Am
I'm gonna marry her anyway
 
  F
Marry that girl
 G
Marry her anyway
  C
Marry that girl
  Am
Yeah, no matter what you say
  F
Marry that girl
      G
And we'll be a family
 C
Why you gotta be so
  Am F G C Am
Rude
 
 
[Verse]
 
 F         G                      C
I hate to do this, you leave no choice
       Am
Can't live without her
 F             G               C
love me or hate me we will be boys
          Am
Standing at that altar
 F         G
Or we will run away
 C                   Am
To another galaxy, you know
     F             G
You know she's in love with me
 C             Am
She will go anywhere I go
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
 F                                 G
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
      C                    Am
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
                F                              G
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
       C                            Am
Tough luck, my friend, 'cause the answer's still 'No"
