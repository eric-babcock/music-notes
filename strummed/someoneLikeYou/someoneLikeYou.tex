\textbf{Verse 1}
I [G]heard that you're [D]settled down 
That you [Em]found a girl 
And you're [C]married now 
I [G]heard that your [D]dreams came true 
Guess she [Em]gave you things

Or [C]hide from life

I [D]hate to turn up out of the [Em]blue uninvited [C]but

[G]Never mind, I'll [D]find someone like [Em] [C]you 
I wish [G]nothing but the [D]best for [Em]you [C]too 
Don't [G]forget me I [D]beg I [Em]re-member you [C]said 
Sometimes it [G]lasts in love but [D]sometimes it hurts [Em] [C]in-stead 
Sometimes it [G]lasts in love but [D]sometimes it hurts [Em]instead, [C]yeah 

\textbf{Verse 2}
[G]You'd know how [D]time flies 
Only [Em]yesterday 
was the [C]time of our lives 
We were [G]born and raised 
In a [D]summer haze 
Bound [Em]by the surprise of our [C]glory days
