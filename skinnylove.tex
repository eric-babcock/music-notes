\textbf{Verse 1,2}
[Am/]Come on, skinny lo[C///]ve, just last the year
[Am/]Pour a little sa[C///]lt, we were never here
My, my, [Am/]my, my, my, [C///]my,  my, my
Staring at the [D6sus2//]sink of blood and crushed veneer[Am/C/]

\textbf{Chorus}
And I [C//]told you to be patient\\
And I [G]told you to be fine[F]\\
And I [C//]told you to be balanced\\
And I [G]told you to be kind[F]\\

\textbf{Bridge}
And in the [C//]morning, I'll be with you
But it will [G]be a different kind[F]
'Cause I'll be [C//]holding all the tickets
And you'll be [G]owning all the fines[F//] 

\textbf{Outro}
[F//]
[C//]Who will love you?
[G]Who will fight?[F/C//]\\
And who will f[G]all 
far be[F////]hind[Am]?

Come on skinny love
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

\textit{Additional lyrics}
Verse:

I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right at the moment, this order's tall

Come on skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassiere
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

Bridge:
And now, all your love is wasted
Then who the hell was I?
'Cause now I'm breaking at the bridges
And at the end of all your lies
